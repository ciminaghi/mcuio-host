This is the first draft of the mcuio protocol implementation (Linux side).
To build for the yun board:

make ARCH=mips CROSS_COMPILE=<your-favourite-cross-compile> \
LINUX=<path-to-yun-mips-linux-kernel>

where <your-favourite-cross-compile> is the path to your cross-compiler, without
the final gcc (i.e.: if the cross-compiler is /foo/bar/mips-openwrt-linux-gcc,
CROSS_COMPILE shall be equal too /foo/bar/mips-openwrt-linux- , notice the final
'-').
<path-to-yun-mips-linux-kernel> is the path where the linux kernel sources for
the yun board have been installed (in my case linino.git/trunk/build_dir/target-mips_r2_uClibc-0.9.33.2/linux-ar71xx_generic/linux-3.8.3)

See Documentation/ for more details.
